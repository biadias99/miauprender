Hi there!
(This ReadMe was written on 08/10/2017 FOR v1.0)

I just wanted to start by saying a special thank you for purchasing this asset pack. It is helping my fund my postgraduate research in 2017-2018. It is about interaction in VR so if you ever want to chat about it, dont hesitate contacting me through my email at the bottom of this readme. This is the first of a series of toy packs I am going to be creating for the asset store so have a look out for them over the coming weeks. 


CONTENT : 
----------

FOLDERS :
---------
1) KD_AlphabetBlocks : Main folder that holds the asset package contents

2) Assets : 
	2a) 3D Objects : Holds the 2 .FBX imported files for the low and high poly model of the block as well as the blank material. 
	
	2b) Prefabs : These are the skinned versions of the low poly model of each letter of the alphabet in each of the 4 colors available. If you want to use the high poly model, just put it in your scene from the "3D models" folder and drag the material from whichever color/letter you want onto it. The materials work for both models. To use any of the blocks, simply choose the right color and letter from the Prefabs folder and drag them to your scene. The prefabs have no collider or rigidbody setup by default and you would have to add them as needed. 
	
	2c) Textures : Here you will find the 4 folders holding the materials for each type of alphabet letter and color combination. Each material was made with an Albedo, Normal and Specular map for a standard Specular material setup. If you find the block looks a bit too "shiny", just reduce the Smoothness value under Specular on the material. Each map is currently imported at 1024 X 1024 resolution to save space, but I do have the 4k resolution versions on hand. If you need any of them, feel free to contact me and I can sort out a way to get them to you. For the entire 64 materials, the 4k Maps come to 27 GB, which is why I could not include them at that resolution. I mainly made them that size to begin with for anyone who would like to use the blocks in movies or very close up situations. There is also a "_forscene" folder, which holds the materials for the example scene. 

3) Example scene : Holds the scene "AlphabetGrid", which you can play at a suggested 16:9 resolution to see how each of the blocks look. The top grey block on the right is the low poly model and the bottom is the high poly model. Mouse over any of the smaller blocks to see their materials on the example rotating blocks on the right. There is also a folder "ScriptsForExample" included in this folder. It holds the scripts needed for the example scene to work. I have included detailed explanation inside the script on how it works. The scripts were written in C#.
